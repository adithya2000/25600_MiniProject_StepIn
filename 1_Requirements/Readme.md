## Introduction
 Hangman is a word guessing game in a particular category played by two players. One player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by guessing letters within a certain number of chances. The name is given because of the chances a player gets to save the person who is being hanged.

## Cost and Features
1. The sketch of the hangman is shown after every wrong guess.
2. The user gets a random word to guess from a given set of words in a particular category.
3. The word to be guessed is shown with blanks instead of the letters of the word.
4. The user gets five chances to guess the word.
## Defining Our System
A set of words is present in a text file for each category. When the user plays the game, a random word is retrieved from the file belonging to the category chosen by the user as the word to be guessed by the user. When the user gives a letter of the alphabet to guess,
* The word is displayed with the letter placed in it in the respective positions if the letter is present in the word.
* If the letter is not present in the word, then the sketch of the hangman (the state of the sketch is shown as per the chances) is shown.

The user wins when he guesses the word correctly within 5 chances. The user loses the game when the sketch of the hangman is complete(after exhausting the chances).
