The foundation of the project has been referred from the Shankar's repo (https://github.com/ShankarBalu/Miniproject_256284), since I had been caught up with my internship and project work. I Have added new functionalities and made changes to the code as well as documentation so as to make sure this project is different and fun to use compared to the others.
