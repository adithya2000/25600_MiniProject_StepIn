The foundation of the project has been referred from the Shankar's repo (https://github.com/ShankarBalu/Miniproject_256284), since I had been caught up with my internship and project work. I Have added new functionalities and made changes to game as well as documentation so as to make sure this project is different and fun to use compared to the others.
